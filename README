RATIONALE
	crazy is suitable scanning anything, it is however designed
	particularly for scanning books, since scanning all of my books
	with simple-scan takes too much work. crazy is develop for me to
	save time, but it also aims to solve the problem that there are
	no good SANE front-ends anymore.
